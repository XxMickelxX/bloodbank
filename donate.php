            </span>
            <span class="ans">
                <p>Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth,
                    children with severe anemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims, and
                    surgical and cancer patients.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It helps save lives</li>
                    <li>You get a free health checkup</li>
                    <li>You become part of a community that cares</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why do we have to wait 3 months before donating again?</h2>
            </span>
            <span class="ans">
                <p> The waiting period of three months before donating blood again is based on several factors. Firstly,
                    it allows the body to replace the blood cells and fluids that were lost during the donation process.
                    It also helps to ensure that the donor's hemoglobin levels return to normal and that their body has
                    had enough time to recover from the donation.</p>
                <p> Additionally, waiting for three months helps to minimize the risk of transfusion-transmissible
                    infections. This is because it takes some time for certain infections to become detectable in the
                    bloodstream. By waiting for three months, the blood bank can test the donor's blood again before
                    using it for transfusion, which helps to ensure the safety of the blood supply.</p>
                <p>Overall, the waiting period is a precautionary measure that is designed to protect both the donor and
                    the recipient. While it may be inconvenient for donors who want to give blood more frequently, it is
                    an important step in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the blood donation process.</p>
